## Security Fixes Implemented

### üî¥ **CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED**

#### 1. Hardcoded Database Credentials ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue:** Database password hardcoded as 'prodapp123' 
- **Risk:** Complete database compromise
- **Solution:** 
  - Implemented enterprise secrets management system
  - Generated cryptographically secure passwords
  - Removed all plaintext credentials from codebase
  - Added fallback error handling with process termination

#### 2. Weak JWT Secret Management ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue:** Default JWT secret with warning fallback
- **Risk:** Authentication bypass through token forgery
- **Solution:**
  - Implemented mandatory JWT secret requirement
  - Generated 64-byte cryptographically secure secret
  - Added secrets manager integration
  - Process terminates if secret not found

#### 3. Disabled Rate Limiting ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue:** Rate limiting commented out for development
- **Risk:** DoS attacks and brute force attempts
- **Solution:**
  - Enabled rate limiting in production
  - Configured appropriate limits (100 req/15min general, 5 login attempts/15min)
  - Added IP-based tracking

#### 4. Insecure WebSocket Authentication ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Issue:** Tokens passed in URL query parameters
- **Risk:** Token exposure in logs and referrers
- **Solution:**
  - Moved authentication to WebSocket protocol headers
  - Implemented server-side token validation
  - Added authentication state tracking
  - Enhanced error handling for invalid tokens
