## Technical Notes

### Development Guidelines
- **Service Pattern** - All new business logic should be implemented in service classes
- **Route Pattern** - HTTP endpoints should only handle request/response concerns
- **Database Pattern** - Use DatabaseUtils for all database operations
- **WebSocket Pattern** - Use req.broadcast() and req.websocket methods for real-time updates
- **Testing Pattern** - Test services independently before route integration

### Future Enhancements
- Unit testing framework for service classes
- API documentation generation from route definitions
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Automated testing pipeline for modular components
- Production deployment strategy for refactored architecture
