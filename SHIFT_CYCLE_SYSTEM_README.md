# 2-2-2 Shift Cycle System - Implementation Guide

## ✅ System Status: **OPERATIONAL**

Your 2-2-2 shift cycle system has been successfully implemented and is ready for use!

## 🔧 **Fixed Issues**

### **Employee Loading Error** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: `Failed to load employees: Error: Request failed`
- **Cause**: Frontend was calling `/employees` endpoint that doesn't exist
- **Fix**: Updated to use existing `/users` endpoint with proper data transformation
- **Result**: Employee dropdown now loads successfully (requires authentication)

### **Graceful Degradation** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Feature**: System still works even if employee loading fails
- **Benefit**: You can configure shift cycles without employee assignments
- **Fallback**: Clear error messages guide users to log in or check permissions

## 🚀 **How to Use the System**

### **Step 1: Access Machine Management**
```
1. Open your browser: http://localhost:3000
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Navigate to "Machine Management"
```

### **Step 2: Enable Shift Cycle**
```
1. Click "Edit" on any machine
2. Scroll down to "2-2-2 Shift Cycle Settings"
3. Check "✅ Enable 2-2-2 Shift Cycle"
4. Set "Cycle Start Date" (e.g., 2025-07-30)
5. Set "Crew Size" (people per shift)
```

### **Step 3: Assign Employees to Crews**
```
Crew A (0 day offset):  Select employees for primary crew
Crew B (2 day offset):  Select employees for second crew  
Crew C (4 day offset):  Select employees for third crew
```

### **Step 4: View Schedule Preview**
The system automatically shows a 14-day preview:
```
Date         Day Shift    Night Shift   Rest
2025-07-30   Crew A       Crew B        Crew C  
2025-07-31   Crew A       Crew B        Crew C
2025-08-01   Crew C       Crew A        Crew B
2025-08-02   Crew C       Crew A        Crew B
```

## 🔄 **How the 2-2-2 System Works**

### **Continuous 24/7 Coverage**
- **3 staggered crews** ensure both day and night shifts are always staffed
- **Each crew follows**: 2 days day → 2 days night → 2 days rest
- **Perfect rotation**: Every day has exactly 1 crew on day + 1 crew on night

### **Crew Offset Pattern**
```
Crew A: Starts immediately (0 day offset)
Crew B: Starts 2 days later (2 day offset)  
Crew C: Starts 4 days later (4 day offset)
```

### **6-Day Cycle Repeats**
```
Days 1-2: Day Shift
Days 3-4: Night Shift
Days 5-6: Rest
(Then cycle repeats)
```

## 📊 **Database Structure**

### **Enhanced Tables**
```sql
machines:
├── shift_cycle_enabled (BOOLEAN) - Enable/disable cycle
├── cycle_start_date (DATE) - When cycle began
└── crew_size (INTEGER) - People per shift

machine_crews:
├── crew_letter ('A', 'B', 'C') - Crew identifier
├── cycle_offset (0, 2, 4) - Days offset from start
└── employees (JSON) - Employee IDs array

crew_assignments:
├── assignment_date - Specific date
├── shift_type ('day', 'night', 'rest') - What crew does
└── auto_generated - Calculated automatically
```

## 🔗 **API Endpoints**

### **Machine Cycle Management**
```
GET  /api/machines/:id/crews           - Get crew configuration
POST /api/machines/:id/crews           - Save crew assignments  
GET  /api/machines/:id/assignments/:date - Get daily assignments
PUT  /api/machines/:id                 - Update machine (includes cycle settings)
```

## 🎯 **Key Features**

### ✅ **Implemented**
- [x] Machine-level cycle enable/disable toggle
- [x] Visual crew assignment interface
- [x] Real-time 14-day schedule preview
- [x] Automatic 24/7 coverage calculation
- [x] Employee assignment to crews
- [x] Graceful error handling

### 🔄 **Ready for Integration**
- [ ] Labor Planner integration (show cycle assignments)
- [ ] Real-time schedule updates  
- [ ] Shift handover notifications
- [ ] Override management (sick days, maintenance)

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **"Failed to load employees" Error**
- **Solution**: Log in to the system first
- **Note**: System still works without employee assignments
- **Check**: User permissions for viewing employees

### **No Preview Showing**
- **Solution**: Set a "Cycle Start Date"
- **Note**: Preview appears automatically when date is set

### **Crews Not Saving**
- **Solution**: Verify you have supervisor/admin permissions
- **Check**: Server logs for detailed error messages

## 📞 **Support**

### **Testing Command**
```bash
node demo-shift-cycle.js
```

### **Server Logs**
```bash
tail -f server.log
```

### **Database Check**
```bash
sqlite3 production.db "SELECT * FROM machines WHERE shift_cycle_enabled = 1;"
```

**🎉 Your 2-2-2 shift cycle system is now ready for production use!**

The system provides perfect 24/7 coverage with automatic crew rotation while maintaining your unique 2-day-day, 2-day-night, 2-day-rest pattern for individual workers.
